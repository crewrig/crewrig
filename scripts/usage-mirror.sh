# usage-mirror.sh — forwarding shim (spec 0253 R3). The command is scripts/usage-mirror.ts;
# this file stays so every caller of `bash scripts/usage-mirror.sh` (the Bash tests, the
# Taskfile before it was rewritten, scripts/lib/usage-store/mirror.js, and
# artifacts/core/rules/60-tools.md until it was rewritten) still reaches it.
# Fails closed: with node absent it writes one Error: line and exits 1; below the
# floor it exits with the floor guard's status and the command is not run.
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/usage-mirror.sh
#   bash scripts/usage-mirror.sh --reconcile
