# check-model-mappings.sh — forwarding shim (spec 0262 requirement 16). The check is
# scripts/check-model-mappings.ts; this file remains so every caller that still runs
# `bash scripts/check-model-mappings.sh` reaches the TypeScript version until the shell files are retired.
#
# It runs the Node.js floor guard (scripts/lib/node-floor-guard.js), then the TypeScript entry
# with every argument and its standard input, and returns the entry's exit status, standard
# output and standard error unchanged. It fails closed: with `node` absent it writes one
# `Error:` line and exits 1; below the floor it exits with the floor guard's status and
# diagnostic, and the entry is not run.
#
# Usage: bash scripts/check-model-mappings.sh [<arguments of scripts/check-model-mappings.ts> ...]
